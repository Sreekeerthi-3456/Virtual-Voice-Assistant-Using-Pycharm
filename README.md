This Repo Consists of building our own VPA using Python and consist's of:
▪ Developed a custom virtual voice assistant (VPA) using PyCharm and integrated essential Python modules like Text to Speech, Py
Audio, and Pyttsx3, achieving effective user command response.
▪ Installed various pip Python modules, including PyWhatkit and Py Jokes, expanding the VPA's features and
functionalities.
▪ Implemented a comprehensive Natural Language Processing (NLP) module into the VPA system to enhance user interaction and
improve speech recognition accuracy by 20%.
For windows users (run those in command prompt/cmt/terminal) For the robot to listen to our voice/speech pip install speechRecognition To speak out, or text to speech pip install pyttsx3 For advance control on browser pip install pywhatkit To get wikipedia data pip install wikipedia To get funny jokes pip install pyjokes For linux users Learn all the above commands on terminal. Make sure to use pip3, because in linux pip refers for python2 and pip3 refers to python3. Install these too - pip3 install pyAudio In case any error pops up install this - pip3 install portAudio Issues If you encounter any problems feel free to open a new issue. Before that check other closed issues and check if your issue matches with any older issues.
